    <description>
      This directory is used to temporarily save out-of-order writes before
      writing to HDFS. For each file, the out-of-order writes are dumped after
      they are accumulated to exceed certain threshold (e.g., 1MB) in memory.
      One needs to make sure the directory has enough space.
